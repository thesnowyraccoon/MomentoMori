  dialogue:
  - Where am I?
  - You're dreaming...
  - You don't remember what happened, do you?
  - "The only way you'll be able to remember anything... \nis through dreaming."
  - Can't you just tell me what happened?
  - I am only here to help you Remy, that is all I can do for you.
  - You'll have to survive each dream to regain fragments of your memory.
  - Survive?
  - Yes. now quickly do as I tell you...
  - WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME!
  - Time for what?!
  - I SAID WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, NOW LISTEN AND DO AS I SAY!
  - 'We''ll start with movement.

    Pressing W will move you up and S will you
    move down

'
  - Pressing A will move you to the left and D to the Right
  - 'Good old fashion WASD, should be simple enough

    Now try it out for yourself!'
  - Good job, you learn fast... well I expected as much.
  - Now you going to need a weapon
  - A weapon for what?
  - Enemies surround this whole world, you need to defeat them to stay alive...
  - Now go pick up that tarot, it will give you a sword.
  - Now that you have your weapon, you need to learn how to use it.
  - You can use "K" to attack, now go try it out on that flower over there.
  - 'Awesome Remy!

    But having a weapon alone won''t help you survive. '
  - You need to be able to evade the enemie's attacks as well.
  - Use "Space" to dash away from the enemy attacks or you can use it as a quick
    speed boost.
  - 'Awesome work! do realise that the more you swing your sword and dash, the less
    stamina you''ll have. '
  - If you have no Stamina you cannot attack! or dash!
  - Pay attention to the bottom corner, that is your stamina bar, it'll help you
    track your stamina in battle.
  - See the stars in the top left Corner?
  - Yes...
  - Those stars carry the amount of time you have left in this world
  - If you run out of stars, your time in this world has ended and you'll wake up
  - Stamina Bar? Stars? Time? You are not making any sense!
  - Do dreams ever make sense?
  - ...
  - Now that you understand everything it is ti- oh one more thing...
  - Remember to pick up Melatonin it'll give you more time in this world, when low
    on time, find Melatonin.
  - It won't do anything if you have not lost any time. So choose wisely on when
    to pick it up.
  - I know it is a lot to take in, but I believe in you Remy, as I always have.
  - Now it's time for you to go.
  - Wait who are yo-
